Java and JavaScript files that were part of my coursework for Duke University's Software Engineering Specialization. Naturally, I do not endorse copying answers or take responsibility for students who hinder their own learning by doing so. This is meant to be a tool to help learn and/or review, as well as a place to archive my work.

Most of the Java files utilize the edu.duke library, which exists in a custom version of the BlueJ developing environment. I haven't been able to make it work without it, but I plan on fixing that *eventually*.
